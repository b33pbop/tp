# GhostConnect User Guide

Hey Ghost Kitchen Managers! 

Welcome to **GhostConnect**, a desktop application designed for managing contacts **quickly and efficiently** for our target users: the **ghost kitchen managers**. 

Ghost kitchen managers oversee the operations of a ghost kitchen, which produces meals exclusively for delivery and takeout, without a traditional space to dine in.

Keeping that in mind, this application aims to help for **tech-savvy ghost kitchen managers** who oversee multiple aspects of their business, including **staff coordination, supplier management, and customer engagement through loyalty programs**. Our target audience values **efficiency, accuracy, and organization**, and seeks tools that allow them to manage complex information quickly without sacrificing clarity.

GhostConnect combines the **speed and precision of a Command Line Interface (CLI)** with the **visual clarity of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, giving users the flexibility to work in the way that suits them best.

With Ghost Connect, users will be able to add, edit, delete and categorise their contact entries into 3 categories: Customers, Suppliers and Staff. 
Users will also have access to various category specific functions depending on the entry's category, which include the following:
- Staff: Updating of Shifts
- Customer: Updating of Points
- Suppliers: Adding, Updating and Deleting of Orders

Assumptions:
- We assume that users are familiar with basic computing concepts such as **file management, shortcuts, and command-based operations**, and are comfortable using tools that **streamline repetitive tasks** and **handle multiple contacts simultaneously**. 
- We assume that all ghost kitchen managers using the application reside within Singapore and only have external contacts within Singapore as well. This implies that all contact entries into GhostConnect are to only include Singaporean numbers.

By the end of this guide, users will be able to **navigate GhostConnect confidently**, leverage its **advanced features**, and integrate it seamlessly into their daily operations to manage staff, suppliers, and customer loyalty programs efficiently.

**If all the rules [above](#person-general-parameters) were followed you will see either of these 2 messages**:

- :white_check_mark:Success (yay!)
  - "New person added: NAME; Phone: PHONE; Email: EMAIL; Address: ADDRESS; Category: CATEGORY"
- :x:Failure (oh no!)
  - Duplicate Entry: "A contact with the name or number already exists in the book."

<box type="info">

**Duplicate Check**

Even if every field is valid, GhostConnect will prevent you from adding:
- a contact with a **name** that already exists, or
- a contact with a **phone number** that already exists.

This feature help prevent unnecessary clutter in your contact list!

</box>

<box type="tip">

**Need to add a contact with the same name?**

This is why we allow a **pair of brackets** at the end of the name to tag each contact!

E.g. Tom (Soon Seng Food Industry) & Tom (Lim Kian Seng Food Supplier) will not set off duplicate rules :smiley:

</box>

**Example**:<br/>
A new **Customer**, **John Doe** signed up for membership, and you hired a new **Staff**, **Betsy Crowe**!
1. `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 c/Customer` <br>
2. `add n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Yishun p/68998899 c/Staff`<br>

![result for above commands](images/addResult.png)

#### **Listing all Contacts: `list`**

<box type="definition">

Shows a list of all persons in the address book.

**When does this come in handy?**

You can use this command to bring back your full contact list after filtering with the [find command](#locating-contacts-by-name-or-category-find)!

</box>

#### **Editing a Contact: `edit`**

<box type="definition">

Edits an existing person in the address book.

</box>

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [c/CATEGORY]`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be replaced by the input values.
* Name and Phone duplicate check still holds when editing contacts.

<box type="important">

**Data Override**

When you change a contact’s **category**, GhostConnect will **automatically** clear fields from the **old category** and apply the fields for the new one.

</box>

**Examples:**

John recently changed his contact number and email!

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com`
  Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

      <td><strong>After</strong><br><img src="images/Edit2.png" width="300"/></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

You realized there was a typo for Betsy's name!

* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower c/Customer`
  Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and category to `Customer`.

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Before</strong><br><img src="images/Edit3.png" width="300"/></td>
      <td><strong>After</strong><br><img src="images/Edit4.png" width="300"/></td>

<box type="definition">

Finds persons whose **names** or **category** contain any of the given keywords.

</box>

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* **Case-insensitive** — `hans` matches `Hans`.

**Examples:**

* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`
* `find customer` returns all persons with `Customer` category

#### **Adding Points to a Customer: `updatePoints`**

<box type="definition">

Award points for specified customer based of amount spent.

</box>

Format: `updatePoints p/PHONE b/BILL_AMOUNT`

* Bill amount can be any positive number with at most 2 decimal points e.g. `50`, `50.15`, `50.1`

* The current thresholds are:
- Member: 0.00 - 99.99 points
- Bronze: 100.00 - 499.99 points
- Silver: 500.00 - 999.99 points
- Gold: 1000.00 - 2499.99 points
- Platinum: 2500.00 points onwards.
- There is a maximum cap at 100,000 points for each customer.

*As per the industry standard, bill amounts are automatically truncated to whole numbers when converting to points.

**Examples:**

* `updatePoints p/98765432 b/100000.00` adds `100000 points` for `John Doe`<br>
  ![result for 'updatePoints p/98765432 b/100000.00'](images/updatePointsResult.png)

#### **Reducing points for Customer: `reducePoints`**

<box type="definition">

Redeems a specified number of points from a customer's account.

</box>

Format: `reducePoints p/PHONE pts/POINTS_TO_REDUCE`

* Can only be performed on Customers.
* The number of points to redeem must be a **positive integer** and not exceed the customer's current balance.
* If the specified customer does not exist, or is not a Customer, an error message will be displayed.
* This command can be used to correct an erroneous addition of points (due to a mistaken updatePoints entry).
* If the customer's points is reduced below a membership tier threshold, the customer's tier is updated automatically.

**Examples:**

* Assuming that the Customer `John Cena` has the phone number `91234567`
* Assuming that `John Cena` currently has 1000 points and is Tier `Gold`
* `reducePoints p/912345667 pts/500`

### Miscellaneous

#### Saving the Data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

#### Editing the Data File

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.
<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, GhostConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the GhostConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my contacts to a new Computer?
<br>
**A**:
1. Install `GhostConnect` on your new computer.
2. Locate the `addressBook.json` file on your old computer and replace the existing `addressBook.json` file in your new computer.
   1. The `addressBook.json` file can be located in `[JAR file location]/data/`.
3. Restart `GhostConnect` on your new Computer. All your contacts should appear.

**Q**: What happens if `GhostConnect` crashes? Will I lose all my contacts?
<br>
**A**: Your data is safe! Your data is automatically saved after every change, simply restart `GhostConnect` and all your contacts should appear.

**Q**: I accidentally deleted a client contact. Can I recover it?
<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, deleted contacts **cannot be recovered** at the moment. We recommend **regularly backing up your contact data** to prevent accidental loss. Future updates may include a recovery or undo feature.

**Q**: Is GhostConnect available on mobile devices?
<br>
**A**: Currently, GhostConnect is optimized for **desktop use only** (Windows, macOS, Linux). This allows for better keyboard interaction and ensures smooth performance for large contact databases.

**Q**: Why use a CLI when a GUI is available?
<br>
**A**: The **CLI** allows users to perform actions **much faster** once they are familiar with the commands—such as adding, editing, or searching for contacts in seconds. However, the **GUI** remains available for users who prefer visual interaction or are still learning the commands. The hybrid design ensures the best of both worlds.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
